# Pascal source code for several data structures

I found this code on floppy disks after a visit with my sons to my parents, it belongs to my early start in development. This is a tour in a crappy museum :)

If you were born after the 80s you have probably never coded in this language, or even seen it. PASCAL was developed in the late 60s but adopted as international standard on 1982. This code was developed in Turbo Pascal.

## What is in it?
Examples of data structures such as

- Queues
- Stacks
- Lists simple and double
- Object files

Code is documented in Catalan :)

## Encoding
Of course files are encoded in `DOS CP 437`
